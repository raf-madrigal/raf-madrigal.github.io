Hi there! I'm Rafael, a Data Scientist who loves using AI to find important information and make new things. I've been working with data for more than 7 years, mainly in banking, utilities, and finance. I know how to mix technical skills with smart planning to get things done well.

I've worked on lots of different projects, learning more about AI and how to work with different teams along the way. This portfolio shows what I've been up to and how I like to make useful stuff that matters. Let's chat and see how we can make cool things together
