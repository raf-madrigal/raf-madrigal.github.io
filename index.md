<p style="font-size:50px">Hi, I am Rafael.</p> 
<p style="font-size:50px">Data Scientist based in Toronto üá®üá¶</p>

(Note: Here'a a link to my LinkedIn for more information: https://www.linkedin.com/in/raf-madrigal/)

Hey there! üëã I'm Rafael, a data scientist with a deep passion for harnessing the power of AI and ML to uncover game-changing insights and build cutting-edge solutions. With 8+ years of experience in analytics, I've spent the last 4 years diving deep into Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Responsible AI, focusing on Explainable AI, Model Fairness, and Differential Privacy.

Throughout my career, I've tackled complex data challenges across highly regulated industries such as banking, finance, and utilities. By combining my technical expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data mining with strategic planning and stakeholder collaboration, I've successfully executed impactful AI projects that drive organizational success.

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Technical Expertise
- Machine Learning: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, ensemble methods, and model optimization
- Deep Learning: CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, and attention mechanisms
- NLP and Generative AI: Large Language Models, Text preprocessing, feature extraction, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, and text generation
- Data Mining: Pattern recognition, anomaly detection, clustering, and association rule mining
- Programming Languages: Python, R, SQL, and Scala
- Libraries and Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy, and Pandas

## üåü Experience Highlights 

- Championed Responsible AI practices at GCash by integrating fairness testing in model development, conducting 30+ pre-deployment model audits focusing on bias and fairness, and data privacy as part of the model governance process
- Co-developed LLM Operations Framework with MLOps and MLE teams at GCash, implementing string matching and NER models to prevent PII processing and storage, ensuring secure deployment of 11 LLM apps for internal and external use
- Implemented Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using Azure OpenAI GPT-4o and Cohere Rerank model at GCash, achieving 86% accuracy in multi-regulatory compliance Q&A, expediting Privacy Impact Assessments, and elevating compliance awareness across data privacy, banking, and AML domains
- Collaborated on pioneering GCash's first AI Ethics charter and roadmap while training 100 data practitioners on model limitations, consequences, and transparency, significantly advancing Responsible AI practices organization-wide
- Led a team of Data Scientists at Unionbank of the Philippines in developing a LightGBM model for property price prediction using web-scraped data and OpenStreetMap geospatial features, achieving 20-58% MAPE and aiding the mortgage group in property valuation üìä
 - Championed Responsible AI at Unionbank of the Philippines by participating in an Australian research institute-led fairness study of the bank's fraud system and presenting findings and other fairness research to leadership, catalyzing internal adoption of Responsible AI
- Spearheaded research on model explainability techniques, including SHAP, LIME, and Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) for scikit-learn models at Unionbank of the Philippines, enhancing internal stakeholders' understanding of AI decision-making processes üîç

## üî¨ Project Interest/s

- Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) particularly LLM applications and Multi-agents
- Model Fairness and Privacy Engineering 
- Recommender Systems and Graph Analytics
- Geospatial Machine Learning

## üìö Sample Work

Some of my projects are found under `Projects`. (I'm trying to produce write-ups for all of them)
