## Hello Again!

### What I do

1. I expect to complete my [M.Sc in Data Science](https://msds.datascience.aim.edu/) degree at the [Asian Institute of Managment](aim.edu) (AIM) in **June 2021**. AIM is an international research and management institution co-founded by Harvard Business School. 

2. My professional experience is mainly on **Corporate Planning**. At work, I combined my engineering and business expertise to guide middle and senior (C-suite) leadership through the rigorous cycle of corporate planning (strategy development, business planning) and KPI Management

3. Outside of work, I work in several Youth organizations focused on the Planet SDGs (Clean Water and Sanitation, Clean Energy, Live on Land, Life under Water, and Climate Change). Some of these organizations include:
- 2030 Youth Force in the Philippines, Inc. as an SDG 6 Ambassador
- Reboot Philippines as a Renewable Energy Ambassador
- Philippine Young Water Professional as an Asst. Dir. for Training and Development

### What Interests Me

When it comes to data science, my research inclinations are in the following (not in order):
- Advanced Data Mining
- Complex Systems and Network Science
- Natural Language Processing
- Geospatial Analysis
- Recommender Systems

Some of my projects are found under `Projects`. My desire is to tame the chaos (or the VUCA world) through Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and to help organizations navigate towards a data future.

In my free time, I fancy watching movies or series on YouTube or Netflix or listening Indie (local/ international) music on Spotify. From time to time, I travel solo to La Union or Siargao and test my surfing skills.
